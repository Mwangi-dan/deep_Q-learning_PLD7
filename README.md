# DeepQ Model Atari
This project implements Deep-Q Learning to make an agent that plays Galaxian game on Atari.


### Key Features:
- **Training with Stable-Baselines3's DQN**
- **Multiple policy architectures (CNN & MLP)**
- **Hyperparameter tuning for performance improvements**
- **Logging & saving models for reproducibility**


## ðŸ“Š Hyperparameter Experiments

| Hyperparameter Set | Policy | Noted Behavior |
|-------------------|--------|---------------|
| **lr=1e-4, gamma=0.99, batch=10000, epsilon_start=1.0, epsilon_end=0.05, epsilon_decay=0.1** | **CnnPolicy** | Initial high exploration led to inconsistent rewards. By episode 5, the agent exploited learned strategies, reaching 1500 points. <br> Mean Episode Length: 569 <br> Mean Reward: 640 |
| **lr=0.00005, gamma=0.99, batch=32, epsilon_start=1.0, epsilon_end=0.01, epsilon_decay=0.1** | **CnnPolicy** | There was high exploration which initially generated random high-rewards. <br> A very low learning rate prevented the model from forgetting. <br> Model learned meaningful strategy and got the highest score of 4190. |
| **lr=1e-3, gamma=0.95, batch=64, epsilon_start=1.0, epsilon_end=0.1, epsilon_decay=0.05** | **MlpPolicy** | Mean Episode Length: 385 <br> Mean Reward: 540 <br> Limited exploration by the agent. |
